# Vote

Voting frontend. Existing routes are unchanged:

- `GET /` renders the voting page.
- `POST /` enqueues `{voter_id, vote}` on the Redis `votes` list.
- `GET /healthz` reports Redis readiness.

`GET /api/options` returns the current option labels as JSON:

```json
{"a": "Cats", "b": "Dogs"}
```

Labels come from `OPTION_A` and `OPTION_B`, defaulting to `Cats` and `Dogs`.
